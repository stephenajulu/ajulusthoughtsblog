If you’re going to be spending your time hacking, you need a powerful and robust hacking laptop. Hacking involves cracking passwords, penetration testing, DDoS attacks, and intruding networks. These activities require your hardware to handle heavy amounts of data, be able to run virtual machines, have access to programming environments, and be able to do all of this without freaking out. Having a laptop that looks cool is also a bonus.

## What Specs are Important on Hacking Laptops?

### RAM

For a hacking laptop, 8GB RAM should be the absolute minimum. 16GB or 32GB is more realistic, especially if you’re running multiple virtual machines and can see yourself expanding your hacking activities as time goes on. If you’re unsure you can get a 16GB laptop which is extendable to 32GB.

### Storage

You want SSD over HDD if you can. 250GB and onwards is optimal since you’ll want enough storage for applications and data sets but a huge amount of storage isn’t needed for hacking.

### Graphics Card

2GB minimum but you’ll feel the difference with 4GB. If you intend to use your laptop for brute force hacking you’ll want a minimum of 4GB and possibly more depending on your hacking operation.

## Other Features

These aren’t specs but rather other important factors you should consider when looking for a hacking laptop. You’re going to want a laptop with a long battery life so you can maximize portability and hack on the go. You’re also going to want a lightweight laptop for the same reason – you’ll be less likely to carry your laptop around if it’s heavy and cumbersome.

You’ll also want to invest in a mouse for your laptop. Using a mouse makes it much easier to quickly dart across the screen than using a trackpad does.

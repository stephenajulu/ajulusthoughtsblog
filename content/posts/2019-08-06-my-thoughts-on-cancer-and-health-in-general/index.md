Grab popcorn or rings(dont lie to me i know you like them too, especially the colored ones ðŸ˜‰)

I have always seen health as a personal and simple thing: Take care of your body and it will take care of you. Though i am more of a "wine drinker" even though i most of the times "preach water". But nevertheless that quote is true. But it's simplicity is it's greatest flaw. Technically you are your body. And it's not just about taking care of it. It's doing alot of things.

There are a lot of starting places. But let me put this out in the open. The cause of 70% of sickness that exist in the world is SUGAR. Yes the doctors are right. Avoid sugar. But it's not just the sugar you put in tea or coffee. When doctors tell people to cut out sugar, that is what people cut out. Not realizing that the sugar you put in your tea, is not the main culprit. If i were to ask you to write down the sugar content in each processed food you consume and compile the total that day. You would be shocked.

It is alot. Let's not forget that since people were made sugar conscious, manufacturers/makers of processed foods started hiding the true amount. Putting fake amounts on their cans and boxes.

With this new knowledge i know some of you will try quiting cold turkey. But wait, the fact is, it's impossible. Let me explain why.

Now let science back this post. Sugar is more addictive than cocaine. It triggers the same areas cocaine does but even more. That is why cold turkey cam never work, even though i too encourage it. It is not easy to stop. You will crave it. It's 3 times more addictive than cocaine. And 100 times more available. You can literally walk down to a shop and buy some(sweets etc) for less than 5 shillings. It's readily available. It's everywhere.

Cancers and some tumors live on sugar, specifically........

Hidden sugar are the most dangerous types. Because first you don't know they exist, so even after you "cut" out sugar. Cancer still flourish.

(more info here, 3 paragraphs talk on other causes of cancer)

Now to the cure for cancer. Just like how simple the problem is, the solution is also simple. Cut out ALL sugar even if it is just until our little holistic/herbal medicine works. I know cancer is a multi-billion dollars industry. Pharmaceuticals, doctors and hospitals make billions from it. Several guys who supposedly found the cure to this and more were mysteriously reported dead just days after the release. I fear the same fate but nevertheless i am a firm believer in freedom to information and speech. If you believe in God and you don't know this by now then you better believe Him harder. He made sure to include everything on earth needed for our survival: food, access to unlimited raw materials for shelter and clothing, heat via the sun, and medicine.

It's a concoction that will help for other illnesses but also helps the body fight against cancer cells without affecting normal cells(unlike chemotherapy and others)

It is simple. Buy about 3, 4 or more lemoms and some ginger. Boil some water(half a cup or so). Crush and put in some ginger. Once the water has reached it's boiling point. Remove it from the heat source, pour in a cup. Squeeze the lemons in and then bottoms up. Drink it down. I know the taste but trust me after 4 days you'll be praying to take it again. Take this in the morning on an empty stomach every day. Then after before meals(lunch and supper) every single day. Add honey to taste. Now thid isn't just for cancer. It works for a majority of illness. Add apple cider and now you'll be ready to roll. And dont forget to reduce your carbohydrates as well. Eat foods high in fat or fat itself(eg from animal), moderate proteins and alot more of vegetables and fruits. Remember the posion is in the dose. Meat is not bad, if it was 70% of mankind would have cancer and other meat "caused" issues. Before we even knew how to farm, we were hunters. We ate primarily meat. Yet here we are crumbling due to overpopulation. The poison is in the dose(fun fact: apple seeds have cyanide. A popular posion used during the world wars to avoid interogation upon capture. Yet we eat apples every day, some with it's seeds! It would take approximately 43 apples to die of cyanide poisoning.)

And remember that salt is not your enemy, it is an electrolyte. You can die without it. It helps remove toxins from cells(remember the semi-permeable membrane experiment? Yes that's how it works).

Your body knows how to take care of itself. Don't drink water above 8 glasses unless your body tells you. Even 8 glasses in most cases is too much. Listen to your body. It knows what it wants except when it comes to sugar, starch and drugs. That's not your body, it's your addiction. Remember to brush your teeth with more natural, fluoride free toothpaste.

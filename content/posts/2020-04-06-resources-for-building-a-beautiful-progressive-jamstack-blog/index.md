Hey guys? We are back again this time i want to share with you the tools i used to build this project. I would like to thank the creators and team behind these tools. I use these tools regularly in personal and client projects. But they contributed a great deal to this project. Even though i used a theme. Part 3 is coming soon and you may see UI changes hence the reason i reserved that for last. If you haven't see part 1 and 2 i suggest you do.

Hi there! How are you? My name is Stephen Ajulu. I live in Nairobi, Kenya. I am a Student, Front End Web Developer, Ethical Hacker, Researcher, Content Creator(Blogger) and Graphics/UI/UX Designer.

The Author of Ajulu's Thoughts

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.

I have always had a high level of enjoyment and excitement that comes from being able to solve problems, create new things and learn(I have an appetite for knowledge). It is the main reason i started started my blog back in 2016, to increase awareness, educate and help people learn through research. You can visit the blog here: [Ajulu’s Thoughts](https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com).

Here are some of the companies i have founded and/or co-founded i.e. OwlSec Technologies, Quevant e-Store, Alusa SS Investment among, Pineteso(coming soon, social media for photographers) among others.

I created my social media presence because i wanted to build my personal brand and share knowledge.

My goal is to spread cybersecurity, ethical hacking, privacy and anonymity awareness and help grow our community in the process.

I am currently most interested in web applications, networks, cybersecurity, ethical hacking, android and technology in general.

During my free time, i enjoy reading, playing games, blogging, researching(i believe knowledge is power), fine tuning my skills, creating things(websites, logos, etc), watching movies(Genres: Sci-Fi, Tortured Genius, Cyberpunk among others).

Last time(Tecno Spark 3 series) saw unprecedented sales. Even surpassing the companies expectations and so they decided to continue the series. As from the time of writing this post there's only 1 device i know announced and present in Kenya. The Tecno Spark 4.

![](https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/huawei-y-series-2019-2.jpg?w=600)

Huawei has reinvented the Y series and introduced to us high end budget devices and yes most of the times those 2 words never go together but i am impressed, i the "chosey"(I like my phone with certain features) phone guy. This lineup features Y5, Y6, Y7 and Y9, all with their sub categories Normal, Prime and Pro. Since this list is huge, i will link the search page then you can choose the device you like. [**Huawei Y5, Y6, Y7, Y9 Primes, Pros**](https://c.jumia.io/?a=16624&c=9&p=r&E=kkYNyk2M4sk%3D&ckmrdr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jumia.co.ke%2Fcatalog%2F%3Fq%3Dhuawei%2By&utm_campaign=16624).

### Redmi Note 6 Pro and Note 7

![](https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/external-content.duckduckgjkvho.com_.jpg?w=1024)

Not everything in this list comes in series. Especially for this, the Redmi Note 7 Pro is definitely not affordable just leave Note 8 but these 2 are. Redmi Note 6 Pro came out late last year and Note 7 sometime middle this year. Well I would suggest you go for the Note 7. With the 48 megapixel camera. Here is the link to [**Redmi Note 6 Pro(Ksh 16,999)**](https://c.jumia.io/?a=16624&c=9&p=r&E=kkYNyk2M4sk%3D&ckmrdr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jumia.co.ke%2Fredmi-note-6-pro-6.26-4gb-ram-64gb-dual-sim-4g-black-xiaomi-mpg187806.html&utm_campaign=16624) and [**Redmi Note 7**(**Ksh 18,299)**](https://c.jumia.io/?a=16624&c=9&p=r&E=kkYNyk2M4sk%3D&ckmrdr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jumia.co.ke%2Fredmi-note-7-6.3-inch-3gb-ram-32gb-rom-smartphone-48mp-blue-xiaomi-mpg179474.html&utm_campaign=16624).

![](https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/6147d9cdbd61ddd23d4bd0c83fced09f.jpg?w=1024)

I know what you are thinking. Infinix? Yes, yes Infinix is no longer the same. They are making strides to repair their image. This device is very affordable, spots a triple camera setup all for Ksh 12,000. It's a steal. Check it out here: [**Infinix Smart 3 Plus(Ksh 11,599)**](https://c.jumia.io/?a=16624&c=9&p=r&E=kkYNyk2M4sk%3D&ckmrdr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jumia.co.ke%2Fsmart-3-plus-6.2-32gb-2gb-dual-sim-4g-black-infinix-mpg171137.html&utm_campaign=16624)

The durability king is back, long live the king. They came in 2016 with a bang and have decided to stay producing both high end and budget smartphones. Today is all about the budget. Since they started releasing .1s and .2s and the . plus i have been following their lineup very closely. I myself own the Nokia 6, it has taken falls like a pro, still working like the first time i got it. Since Nokia 6 they have released some "spicy" budget phones.

A good phone with a great camera. Infinix surely outdid itself with this one. Released early this year. It features a 32 Megapixel front camera and a triple camera setup on the back. In fact it was the first phone i saw with 3 cameras. Bravo! Check it out here: **[Infinix Hot S4(Ksh 15,000)](https://c.jumia.io/?a=16624&c=9&p=r&E=kkYNyk2M4sk%3D&ckmrdr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jumia.co.ke%2Fhot-s4-6.2-32gb-3gb-dual-simquad-core-1.4-ghz-blue-free-data-cable-infinix-mpg165722.html&utm_campaign=16624)**

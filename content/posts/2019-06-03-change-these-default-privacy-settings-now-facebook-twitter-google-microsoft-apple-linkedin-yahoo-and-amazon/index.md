From 2018 to the past few months of 2019, our personal data from social media sites and other tech giants has been hacked, scandalized and or abused breaching our [privacy](https://techweez.com/?s=privacy). It is now high time we go through the default privacy settings of most of these sites. In this guide, we’ll try and simplify the settings and change the default and bring back control back to you. Most of the steps work well if you access the sites from the web.

## Facebook

Change who can see your Facebook friends from **public** to **friends** or **only me** using this [link](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy).

![](https://i2.wp.com/techweez.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Timeline-and-Tagging-Settings.png?resize=640%2C319&ssl=1)

Review posts you’re tagged in before the post appears on your timeline using this [link](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=timeline).

Switch to **No** to Facebook’s face recognition using this [link](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=facerec). Facebook won’t be able to recognize you in photos and videos and thus won’t recommend tagging you in photos but the downside is that you won’t get a heads-up from the [social media giant](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/managing-your-identity-on-facebook-with-face-recognition-technology/) when someone else posts a photo of you. It has its own privacy [controversies](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/04/19/facebook-growing-use-facial-recognition-raises-privacy-concerns/526937002/).

On the Ad preferences settings [page](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen), head over and **switch off** ads based on your relationship status, employer, job title and education

While you’re still here, scroll down and toggle on the **Not Allowed** for Ads based on your activity on Facebook Company Products that you see elsewhere and Ads based on data from partners.

## Twitter

Disable personalization used for [ad targeting](https://techweez.com/2019/05/30/why-youre-seeing-more-promoted-tweets/) using this [link](https://twitter.com/settings/personalization).

## Yahoo

To turn off personalized advertising, use this [link](http://yahoo.mydashboard.oath.com/). The link gives you access to your dashboard where you can disagree or toggle off options including Precise Location.

## Google

Turn off [web and app activity](https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols?pli=1) so that Google doesn’t know you well and while you’re there you can also pause [location history](https://techweez.com/2018/08/14/google-location-history/). Google has said that in the future it will stop asking you to turn on this function when you first set up Google Assistant on your Android phone.

Toggle [Sharing Profile edits](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/activity-broadcast) to No so that LinkedIn doesn’t broadcast your change in your connection.

Change your birthday visibility. Go to LinkedIn, click on the Me icon, View Profile, Tap on contact info, click edit when the window pops up and then under birthday select Only You.

![](https://i0.wp.com/techweez.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LinkedIn-Ads.png?resize=640%2C473&ssl=1)

Switch [ad settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/advertising) to No. Also while you’re here, switch off [Profile data](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/advertising/profile-data) for ad personalization.

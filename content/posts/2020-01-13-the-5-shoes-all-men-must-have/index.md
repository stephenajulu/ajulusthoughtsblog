Hey everyone, how are you all doing? Yeah is here 2020! Happy New Year! Well guys(sorry ladies this goes to the guys but you can upgrade your man's shoe game and besides yours is coming soon so stick around and subscribe to the blog.) Guys, guys, guys this is a big year for us. We can't be floppy like last year we need to up our game! Especially this 1 game women have been complaining about.........Shoes. As "they" say women start looking from the bottom up. So here's to upgrading. Top 5 shoes every man needs and MUST have. So 1.....

## Leather Boots

A boot—whether a lace-up, a suede desert boot, or a Chelsea model—is a wardrobe staple that enhances your look. 

1 most preferred are Chelsea Boots. They are versatile. Can be paired with both casual and formal clothing even though formal is usually debated. Good when its cold or raining.

Personally I’d wear Chelsea Boots with denim, having a small turn up to show the elastic detailing on the boot. They also don’t look out of place with a suit dressed down with more modern styles utilizing them with tailoring

## Athletic/Running/Gym Shoes

Whether you are a runner or not these are essential to a man's closet.

There’s nothing better than a sleek pair of athletic shoes. Not only can they function as your gym shoes, but they can be worn with your casual outfits, as well.

I recommend sticking with a black/white, black/grey/white, or navy/white color to ensure that your sneakers compliment all your outfits.

## Black Oxford/Derby/Dress Shoes

How the heck do you expect to look great in formal without these? If i said Athletic is essential then these are essentialer! This should have been no 1. Formal Shoes are a must. Both for Young Gentlemen and old. These just show how mature and awesome you are. Let's not forget women first analyze you from the down up. If your shoe game ain't good. Forget it!

Every man needs at least a black and possibly brown pair of dress shoes in his wardrobe. They go well with all outfits outside of a super casual outfit (think: t-shirt and jeans). And since you should at least own one suit, these are necessary because you can’t get away with wearing any other shoes with your suit. Remember: the goal is to have you looking amazing, no matter the scenario or outfit.

## Loafers

The loafer is a shoe you can wear all year round. It's the most versatile. Comfortable.

Wear them without socks or below ankle socks. Stick with Black or Dark Brown. Buy Suede if needed.

## White Sneakers

Another essential. Especially for casual.

They’re clean, classy and look great with a lot of your casual, even up to a little more dressy, outfits. Throw on a nice fitted blazer and some dark wash jeans with them and they’ll look amazing

Jordan’s and Air Force Ones are not the same as these – even if they’re white – because the shape and profile of those shoes are completely different.

Well guys that's all for today. One important thing to note. Guy's you need a shoe cleaning kit. You can't be walking around with dirty shoes, they reflect how irresponsible you are so buy one! Have a good day.

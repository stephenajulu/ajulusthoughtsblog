Leading telecommunications giant Safaricom is set to launch the 5G network in Kenya in a move that stamp the company’s authority in the communication sector.

According to Acting CEO Michael Joseph, Safaricom has completed testing and trials for the upgraded network and will be ready to launch before the end of this year. The launch of Kenya’s first fifth-generation (5G) mobile internet services will target major urban centres and will be a first in the region.

The major towns that will be target will include Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru and Kakamega, which routinely witness increased data traffic.

“We are ready to launch (5G) technically, but will choose the right time to officially launch later this year,” Mr. Joseph said in an interview with the local business newspaper, Business Daily.

The 5G launch will follow the December 2015 unveiling of the 4G network by the company.

“Safaricom has in recent years been working with Huawei, a Chinese company, which has been the subject of increased scrutiny in the Western world over the launch of 5G networks. Huawei remains one of Safaricom’s top suppliers for the core transmission network and mobile money infrastructure, but Mr Joseph could not reveal if it was involved in the 5G project. Last February, however, officials from both firms intimated that they would work together on a 5G project. They spoke on the sidelines of the World Mobile Congress held in Barcelona, Spain,” the [Business Daily](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/corporate/companies/Safaricom-set-for-5G-network-launch/4003102-5453976-84hqeqz/index.html) reported.

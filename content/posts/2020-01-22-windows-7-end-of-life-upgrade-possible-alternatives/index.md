title: "Windows 7 End of Life: Upgrade & Possible Alternatives"
date: "2020-01-22"

Hey guys, Windows 7 reached its end of life a week ago and i know how we still dont want to let go. Window 7 was released on October 22 2009. It has been one of the most successful OS. Recent reports show that it's still being used by 39% of the PC users.

#### What does end of life mean?

This basically means Microsoft will stop releasing updates and patches for Windows 7. It's also likely that they will end support as well.

However currently it's in its 'extended support' phase.

#### Why you should move on to another OS?

With no updates and patches, things can get quite tough. First no more bug fixes, security patches or new functionality and Windows 7 is already being targeted by hackers already, with end of life this is going to be rampant. With new malware being created each day. You will likely run into security issues. This means it will be more susceptible to attacks just like Windows XP. Microsoft however has mentioned that those reluctant to upgrade to Windows 10 will be able to receive support but at a cost

## Alternatives

### Windows 10

Now i know this is not what many users will want because they had the chance to upgrade for free to Windows 10. But Windows 10 isn't that bad. It's actually great. Though if you have old hardware it's time to upgrade your hardware because there are new minimum requirements.

Here are the recommended specs

- **RAM**: 1 Gigabyte(Gb) for 32bit or 2 Gigabyte(Gb) for 64. **_4 Gigabyte(Gb) for 64bit is Preferred_**.
- **Hard Disk**: 16 Gigabyte(Gb) for 32 bit or 20 Gigabyte(Gb) for 64bit. **_60 Gigabyte(Gb) for 64bit is Preferred_**.
- **Processor**: 1 Gigahertz(GHz) or faster. **_2.0 Gigahertz(GHz) is preferred_**.
- **Graphics Card**: DirectX 9 supported or newer with WDDM 1.0 Driver
- **Display**: 800 x 600 Resolution

### Ubuntu

Linux isn't how it used to be anymore. Many come with easy installation and preinstalled drivers and common softwares. Ubuntu is one of these. It has a slick user interface. A slight learning curve and a lot of free open source software. There are new updates released a couple of times in a month. And best yet no need to restart your computer for updates. Many who leave Windows come here. Very intuitive and colorful. You will have to learn a few basic things here and there but trust me you'll like it. And a major benefit of Linux is that it's extremely resistant to malware and viruses, now note am not saying impervious, it's resistant. This applies to all linux distributions.

### Linux Mint

This is another one, in Linux there are distributions. This is another good one. It's UI will feel slightly similar since it looks like Windows 7. You get stable releases once in a while, possible 3 to 4 times a month for software and once a month or sometimes once in 3 months for the kernel. Comes with drivers and common software. Has a nice UI. However there is still a slight learning curve but once you open linux in front of people they start thinking you are a tech genius because there is this myth that linux is for developers. Don't believe it. Linux is great! You get to do whatever you want in terms of customization. It doesn't spy on you. You can add features through installing apps.

### MacOS

This is another great one. The operating system that power Macs. You get frequent updates, a nice UI. A ton of interesting features. I won't talk about this much because my knowledge of this OS is limited but it's a great OS. Slight learning curve just like the rest but you'll be fine. The major problem with this is software is expensive. But you get an OS that can run resource hungry apps. This is especially good for graphic designers and developers.

### ElementaryOS

Probably the most beautiful OS or 2nd beautiful. It's linux. Comes with an easy way to install it. Has preloaded software and drivers. It's great. Very beautiful UI and just like all the other linux distributions listed above it is extremely customizable. Don't like the app drawer just remove it and install another. Or change the entire look and feel with a new Desktop Environment like KDE, Gnome, XFCE and more.

There are literally hundreds of Linux Distributions to choose from. There's [**Zorin**](https://zorinos.com/), **[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org)**, [**MX Linux**](https://mxlinux.org/). I will be writing an article on the top 10 linux distributions and i will review them in depth. If you want the most preferred ones go check this site out: [**DistroWatch**](https://distrowatch.com). You can get a distribution that matches you. Remember everything in life has a learning curve. Try linux. You won't be disappointed.

To all Windows 7 users, backup your data. Prepare for migration. Remember you can test linux distributions yourself right on Windows 7 by using virtualization technology. Download [**VirtualBox**](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [**VMware**](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=WKST-1551-WIN&productId=799&rPId=39505) and virtualize these OS. If you like them then go to a full hard disk install. I have done a video in virtualization though not the best it can prove useful, will be redoing it. In the mean time go check it out: [**Stephen Ajulu on The Art of Virtualization**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgmMJd06g-8).

Have a wonderful day!

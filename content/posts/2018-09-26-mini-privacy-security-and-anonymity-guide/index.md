Bookmark this blog, and stay tuned to more. And of course like, comment and share, if you have anything to add comment down below, and I will add it.

Aside from that I have to give credit where credit is due, this is not fully my work, I only modified it, added a few things and styled it. I got this from GitHub. It was forked by Triclorne (Bright Gameli) and I believe the author is [https://github.com/Trietptm-on-Security/simple-opsec](https://github.com/Trietptm-on-Security/simple-opsec). So if you want the original go to [https://github.com/triclorne/simple-opsec](https://github.com/triclorne/simple-opsec) Since the author's page is missing. For those who want to follow me in GitHub: [https://github.com/4julu](https://github.com/4julu). Click this link [README.md](https://github.com/4julu/operation-privacy-anonymity-security.git).

HMD Global and Nokia, recently released new Android™ 7.1.1 flagship phones, after a long while of being silent and their exit from the market. The last devices Nokia had left us were all powered by Windows™, which according to my view were not all that great(to some extent,especially on apps), though it was quite interesting to see Windows™ on a Smartphone.

But this time they have come with a big bang! The first phone released was Nokia 6 followed by Nokia 5 then Nokia 3, which we will talk about in another post(Stay Tuned).

The Nokia 6 is definitely a phone worth having. After a week of use, i can say this phone is much more interesting than what meets the eye.

Made of pure Aluminum and Sculpted Gorilla Glass 3 screen, this phone is definitely one for the clumsiest people, It is tough and has a very satisfying premium metallic feel. Nokia Well Done!

It comes with a 16 mega-pixels back camera which is very good, the details are clear though not as expected, will post some photos i took with it in a short while. The back camera also supports full HD video recording.

This mid range device come with dual tone LED flash for a more natural light perception. Though the camera does protrude a bit, so expect it to wobble when placed on a table. Brownie Points come in since the camera is protected by the same type of glass that the screen has except the LED flash.

It also comes with an 8 mega-pixel front camera, sadly no led flash but still takes pretty good photos, with 50% details seen. This camera is also a wide angle camera, it can fit up-to 4 people in horizontal mode and up to 7 people in vertical mode. Quite nice for a mid-range phone.

Being built 90% completely out of a single block of Aluminum, with the Antenna bands and flash diffuser/covering being made out of plastic, expect this phone to survive a couple of falls. The 5.5" inch Corning® Gorilla® Glass is a 2.5D tough glass, capable of surviving car keys and coins to a certain level. The glass does look very attractive. Much like a premium phone(as it is one).

After thorough tests, the body doesn't flex at all. Making this device one of the toughest around. Will include the video link on the stress tests done on the body and screen. The display is also Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS LCD , and the viewing angles are quite interesting with wide color reduction.

The device comes with Dual Stereo Speakers with Dolby Atmos®, so expect quite unique and loud sound + Bass, which by my book is excellent for audiophiles. Yey! for me.

Looking at the performance, there are some cons, coming with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor (Made for Power Optimization), isn't really a powerhouse, but it is more than capable for daily use. Though there are quite some minute lags when opening power intensive apps such as Instagram and heavy games such as Asphalt Airborne but trust me, you might not even notice them.

Apart from that it comes with 3 GB RAM. Which is great considering the not so great processor. But both the Arte Black and Chinese Version come with 4 GB RAM. The Global version come with a 32 GB Internal Memory while the Chinese version comes with 64 GB.

NB: **What is Infrared**: **Infrared radiation** (IR) is [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") (EMR) with longer [wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength") than those of [visible light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light"), and is therefore generally invisible to the human eye (although IR at wavelengths up to 1050 nm from specially pulsed lasers can be seen by humans under certain conditions [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared#cite_note-Sliney1976-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared#cite_note-LynchLivingston2001-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared#cite_note-Dash2009-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared#cite_note-Saidman1933-4)). It is sometimes called **infrared light**. IR wavelengths extend from the nominal [red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red "Red") edge of the [visible spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum "Visible spectrum") at 700 [nanometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometer "Nanometer") ([frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_spectrum "Frequency spectrum") 430 [THz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_(unit) "Terahertz (unit)")), to 1 [millimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimeter "Millimeter") (300 [GHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHz "GHz"))[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared#cite_note-5) Most of the [thermal radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation "Thermal radiation") emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared.

Now as you know, TV, Radio and some other many types of remote using Infrared tend to not function sometimes, always leaving you frustrated and angry when having your Netflix or Movie Night Marathon Moment, and usually you end up replacing the batteries without knowing if the previous one actually died or just a remote malfunction. Here is a quick tip to see whether your remote batteries are dead or not without moving 5 inches.

We are in the smartphone age ahem….. sorry Information age, and we all know Information is power right? Now to the tip badum….badum…badum….tish(I actually googled this, it’s a drum roll…………in words! :-O ), a simple trick is, take out your smartphone. Open your camera app, then point the remote at the camera, and press any button on the remote, if you see a bluish, violet, reddish or purplish light from that bulb, know that your remote is functioning well and that you should move your lazy self, and find a better angle and press the button of choice, try all angles possible.

And that’s it for today folks, stay sharp, nice day.

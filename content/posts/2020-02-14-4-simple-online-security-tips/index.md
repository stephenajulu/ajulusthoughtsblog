Hi! How are you today? Today i want to share with you 3 simple tips to stay secure in the cyber world and protect yourself from hackers.

### 1\. Ditch Old Passwords, Get a Password Managers and TRY ENABLING 2FA.

I believe the best way to stay secure i to have a password system. Build a password system. Make sure you change all your passwords every 3 to 6 months. Get a password manager, this will help you stay secure and many come with the option to generate passwords. No longer should you remember long passwords. I recommend [**Lastpass**](https://www.lastpass.com/), [**BitWarden**](https://bitwarden.com/) and [**Dashlane**](https://www.dashlane.com/).

### 2\. UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE!

Updating software is highly important. Updates are basically patches to previously found bugs and vulnerabilities. Hence it is important to update your software, from OS to the Web browser.

There are several nifty tools, especially when it comes to software. Try **[Ninite](https://ninite.com/)**

### 3\. Avoid Oversharing

Oversharing is one of the most common entry points for hackers. Limit how much information you share..

### 4\. Avoid public Wi-Fis, suspicious email attachments and unknown websites

Hacking has become dangerously easy thanks to common human practices like logging into public Wi-Fi or opening attachments from people you don't know or visiting sites that look fake(fake logos, fake url eg instead of carrefour.com it is carrrefour.com. Be vigilant because the weakest link is always you.

Hey guys?

I have been investing in both ethereum and bitcoin from time to time. And i can certainly say both have experienced much growth with bitcoin taking the lead. But I've always asked one thing. Which cryptocurrency is better? Which will last? How has and will they help the community at large? Now these 2 are absolutely different so let's dive in and find out how and why.

## Basics

### **Bitcoin**

- Launched in 2009, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and the first use of blockchain technology
- Bitcoin is a digital currency
- It aims to fix the problems in global finance, often referred to as the “bank of the people”
- Bitcoin does not require a third party, such as PayPal or a bank
- Created as an alternative to regular/fiat currencies (i.e. USD, EUR, JPY, etc.)
- Used for manual transactions, like purchasing goods/services or receiving money
- It is highly liquid (it’s the trading volume is $8.9m in the last 24 hours), which means you can easily convert Bitcoin into cash
- It takes minutes to complete Bitcoin transactions

### **Ethereum**

- Launched in 2015, Ethereum’s blockchain widely known synonym is “Blockchain 2.0”
- Smart contracts program the transactions (which I will explain further in this guide)
- Its smart contracts eliminate the need for third parties in many systems, not just financial systems
- It provides a platform to build smart-contract apps (known as dApps)
- It provides a programming language, called Solidity, to build the dApps with
- Ether is its currency, it powers transactions on the Ethereum blockchain
- Ether is highly liquid (it’s trading volume is $2.4m in the last 24 hours)
- Ethereum’s transactions take seconds to complete

Now as we can see Bitcoin's main strength is the fact that it's a cryptocurrency that's all, while ethereum is digital money and far far more even it's creator still doesn't know it's full potential, something only time will tell. Now just from this you can see which is going to last longer and will provide value to the world but let's dive even deeper.

Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform with many aspects. It features smart contracts, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and it uses its currency called ether for peer-to-peer contracts.

Ethereum’s smart contracts use blockchain stored applications for contract negotiation and facilitation. The benefit of these contracts is that the blockchain provides a decentralized way to verify and enforce them. The decentralized aspect makes it incredibly difficult for fraud or censorship. Ethereum’s smart contracts aim to provide greater security than traditional contracts and bring down the associated costs.

The [smart contract](http://blockgeeks.com/guides/smart-contracts/) applications are powered by ether, Ethereum’s blockchain based cryptocurrency. Ether, as well as other crypto-assets, are held in the Ethereum Wallet, which allows you to create and use smart contracts.

## **Key differences**

Let’s look at the main differences between Ethereum vs Bitcoin, some of which you can see by comparing the basics I just mentioned!

#### **Their concepts**

When you think of Bitcoin, think “digital money”. When you think Ethereum, think “smart contracts”. This is the easiest way to understand and remember the primary difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum!

#### **Their purposes**

Bitcoin is a store of value and a way to send money to someone. Ethereum is also a way to send money to someone but only when certain things happen. 

Ethereum also differs by serving as a building platform for dApps/smart contracts, which allow it to send tokens that represent values. These values can be things other than digital currencies, making it different from Bitcoin.

#### **Their transactions**

Bitcoin’s transactions look like this:  
Jade sends 10 BTC (Bitcoins) to Pete.

Ethereum’s transactions run on smart contracts and look like this:  
Send 10 ETH (Ether) from Jade to Pete _if_ Jade’s balance is 15 ETH and the date is 12.01.2019.

So, Bitcoin’s transactions are manual and Ethereum’s transactions are automatic/programmable!

#### **The speed of the transactions**

Ethereum’s block time (transaction speed) is just seconds. Bitcoin’s block time, however, is minutes.

#### **The currencies:** **Ether vs Bitcoin**

- Ether is designed to fuel the Ethereum network and power transactions — think of it as _gas._
- Bitcoin is used to be the value of real-world transactions — think of it as _money_.

#### **Their coin supply**

Bitcoin is limited to 21,000,000 coins. This creates supply and demand, which is healthy for a store of value.

Ethereum, however, is _not_ limited. The production of Ether is continuous. The supply of Ether will slow down a lot over time though.

Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, stated that [the total number of coins will not reach more than 100,000,000 ETH in the “foreseeable future”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5izcf5/lets_talk_about_the_projected_coin_supply_over/)

#### **Their ages**

Ethereum is 6 years newer than Bitcoin and is further advanced.

Bitcoin has a very limited set of features, consumes an exorbitant amount of electricity, and is thus terrible for the environment. Transactions are fairly expensive and very slow.

**BUT**, and here is the big BUT, the best technology seldom wins. The first mover status of Bitcoin cannot be underestimated. x86 was one of the worst CPU architecture for personal computers, but it won in the end because it had first mover advantage, which meant high volume in production and more money thrown at all the deficiencies of the architecture.

For Bitcoin there are far more services, software, mindshare etc allocated than the competition. A lot of people are working on making it better. A better design may not win, if the poor design has far more people working on making it better.

While **Ethereum** has far more capabilities than Bitcoin, it is also fairly complex. I think Bitcoin has a security advantage in following a simpler model, where less room for mistakes.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are both helpful. They have both contributed to significant value gain in the last year. If you compare Bitcoin with Ethereum, The percentage of gain is lesser in Bitcoin. Though bit coin was created by before Ethereum, and its value has steadily increased over the last couple of years, Ethereum has also seen a great trigger of value in just some years. The values shot up ahead of Bitcoin and surpassed Bitcoin. Ethereum's value has recently picked up over the past year and it is assumed that this is here to stay and would ride steadily and will sustain over the years as well.

Though Bitcoin and Ethereum do not have much difference, Ethereum is slowly gaining speed and momentum and both of the currencies are here to stay for good.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have _very_ different purposes!

**Ethereum**’s purpose is to offer and run decentralized smart-contract applications powered by blockchain technology that do not go offline and cannot be altered. It provides users with a platform and programming language to build the applications on.

**Bitcoin**’s purpose, however, is largely different. It serves as a decentralized store of value — a peer-to-peer digital currency, used for financial transactions. It eliminates the need for third parties in payment technology.

In conclusion, the primary differences that separate Ethereum vs Bitcoin are their purposes and their concepts. Also, Ethereum’s blockchain runs smart contracts Bitcoin doesn’t and instead only focuses on manual payment technology. So which is the winner?

Well it's not that simple, Bitcoin's value is ever increasing the potential gain wise investors are looking to gain is huge, while ethereum is performing considerably well and is the 2nd top cryptocurrency it is still lagging slightly behind nevertheless, ethereum is still far more advance and has more potential. So.....

After all the discussions, Ethereum is better than Bitcoin at the moment as it is

- A "new" cryptocurrency software platform that runs on updated technology
- It has more availability of coins
- And it is gaining speed and momentum faster compared to Bitcoin.

> _Bitcoin’s founder remains anonymous to this day. Instead of using a real name, the founder used the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto” when founding the project, so that’s how the crypto community refers to the Bitcoin founder. It’s also how the term “Satoshi” (a denomination of Bitcoin) came to be._

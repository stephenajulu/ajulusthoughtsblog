#### First!

### What is a chatbot?

**A chatbot is a service, powered by rules and sometimes artificial intelligence, that you interact with via a chat interface.** The service could be any number of things, ranging from functional to fun, and it could live in any major chat product (Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Text Messages, etc.).

### Why Chatbots Are Such A Big Opportunity

You are probably wondering **“Why does anyone care about chatbots? They look like simple text based services… what’s the big deal?”**

Great question. **I’ll tell you why people care about chatbots.**

It’s because for the first time ever **people are using messenger apps more than they are using social networks.**

This is why chatbots are such a big deal. **It’s potentially a huge business opportunity for anyone willing to jump headfirst and build something people want.**

Chatbots are very important especially for business website. They help you gather data about your new clients. Help perform customer care duties. You can't always be there to interact with potential clients. Hence that's where they come in. Except interaction and customer care, chatbots are key if you want an efficient lead generation strategy. Today I'll talk about the top 5.

### **[1\. Botsify](https://botsify.com/)**

If you’re looking to build a chatbot for Facebook messenger, Botsify simplifies the process by allowing your business to create a bot, no coding required. The AI and [machine learning](https://www.clickz.com/customer-experience-via-the-contact-center-qa-with-calabrio-cmo-rebecca-martin/254626/)\-driven chatbot also draws customer info from responses and includes human takeover and handover options, so customers hoping to speak to a rep won’t ever feel as if they’re being passed off to a robot instead.

### **[2\. Pandorabots](https://home.pandorabots.com/home.html)**

If you’re looking to create chatbots for web, mobile, or other (non-Messenger) platforms, KiK, Twitter, Telegram, Line, and Slack, Pandorabots is a great option. One of the original chatbot hosting services, it’s also one of the largest, which means it offers a wide range of options and support.

### **[3\. Reply.AI](https://www.reply.ai/)**

The chatbot builder used by brands like CocaCola, Samsung, and Starbucks boasts built-in [CRM](http://www.clickz.com/high-roi-email-marketing-platforms/236686/), analytics, and AI and machine learning to optimize responses based on customer feedback.

Collect.chat is a really interesting chatbot builder because it allows businesses to gather information from customers via engaging them in conversation, rather than requiring them to fill out tedious forms. The simple drag and drop builder is most frequently used for “building email lists, scheduling appointments, providing lead generation, collecting feedback from [surveys](https://www.clickz.com/gartner-marketing-budget-report/256128/) and providing guidance on products or services”, [according](https://www.cmswire.com/information-management/top-26-chatbot-builders-for-2019/) to CMSWire. This is my favorite. Using it on my [**personal website**](https://stephenajulu.com) and [**business website.**](https://owlsectechnologies.co.ke)

### **[5\. IBM Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/)**

One of the top chatbot systems around, IBM Watson Assistant uses machine learning to filter customer request to the correct channels as well as directing users to a search engine and passing customers off to a human customer service rep when the need arises. However, it’s the chatbot builder’s capability for industry-specific solutions that makes it a [favorite](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-ai-chatbot) of Clifford Chi at Hubspot: “Pre-trained with content from your specific industry, Watson Assistant can understand your historical chat or call logs, search for an answer in your knowledge base, ask customers for more clarity, direct them to human representatives, and even give you training recommendations to hone its conversational abilities.”

### **But don’t think of chatbots as “just” for customer service**

While chatbots absolutely make it easier for customers to get the information they need, there are several other possibilities for building one into your marketing plan. For example, chatbots are excellent for lead generation. Landing pages with “click to chat” options give customers an easy way for customers to ask questions during their site visits, but including simple questions about location, product preferences, and opinions about past purchases are an excellent way to better personalize future offers.

While chatbots are currently a “nice to have” feature for websites and messaging platforms, it’s likely that they’ll soon be a must-have for managing the customer relationship and gathering important customer data. Getting on board by building your chatbot now could put your business ahead of the curve.

Anyway that's it for today. Have a lovely day!

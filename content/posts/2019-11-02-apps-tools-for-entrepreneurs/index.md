Hello friend!(Mr. Robot Season 4 is out üòÅ) We meet again. I apologize for not posting frequently and so here we are.

Today i would like to talk about the tools, apps and techniques that have helped me start, manage, run and grow my business. Business Website: **[OwlSec Technologies](https://owlsectechnologies.netlify.com).**

**Meant for Entrepreneurs, Freelancers, Content Creators or Personal Brands.**

So without further ado. I present number 1.

#### 1\. **Adobe Spark Post for Android & Online**

This app is basically a poster, ad and semi graphic design app on steroids. It can create animations. It has helped me create stunning designs that really attract and influence people. You can get it here: [**Android App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.spark.post) & **[Website](https://spark.adobe.com/)**

#### **2\. Otter AI**

A good voice recorder with nifty features such as Automatic Transcriber which means Speech to Text. Very good for meetings, school and voice notes. I can assure you, you'll look like Sherlock Holmes or a scientist recording their observations. You can get it here: [**Android App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aisense.otter) & **[Website](https://otter.ai)**

#### **3\. Barcode Generator**

This one i can't stress enough. No one wants to take a business card and write all the contacts then save. We are all becoming a little lazy. Stay with the flow. With this you can create a QR code and all your customers have to do is scan. It's that simple. You can get it here: **[Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blogspot.aeioulabs.barcode)****.** Sadly no website.

#### **4\. Whatsapp for Businesses**

Self explanatory. Who doesn't know Whatsapp? Now this is the same only with interesting business tools eg Auto Responder etc. With this app, businesses can interact with customers easily by using tools to automate, sort, and quickly respond to messages. You can get it here: [**Android App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp.w4b). An alternative is **[Whatshash](https://whatshash.com/)**

#### **5\. Crisp Chat**

A free embed chat app. Just visit the link below, create an account, add the code given to your website and interact with them. I use it in both my **[personal](https://stephenajulu.com)** and **[business](https://owlsectechnologies.netlify.com)** website. It has a playable waiting game. You can get it here: [**Website**](https://crisp.chat/en/) & You can manage it from [**Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.crisp.app)

#### **6\. Google Analytics**

Free analytics for your website and app. Tracks view by device, country and more. Best of all you dont need to open a new account if you already have gmail. You can find it here: **[Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.giant)** & **[Website](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)**

#### **7\. Adobe Scan with QR**

Have a document, no time, need to read it on the go without carrying it? This is a free document scanning app from Adobe, with integrated OCR technology to instantly recognize printed text and handwriting and transform it into document format. You can get it here: **[Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.scan.android)** & [**Website**](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html?promoid=FD1KZP1Y&mv=other)

#### **8\. Canva**

Gone are the days where you needed a graphic designer to help you make quick digital posters to hype your audience or push your content on social media platforms. A graphic design app without the need of expertise. With Canva you can create almost anything. This isn't limited to Posters like Adobe Spark Post, it can create covers, ads, posters, flyers, and much more. It's user interface is intuitive and user-friendly. You can get it here: **[Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.canva.editor)** & [**Website**](https://www.canva.com/)

#### **9\. Desygner**

Pretty much Canva on steroids. This allows you to tweak your publications much better. I‚Äôd highly recommend this as well but it‚Äôs a level higher. Sometimes Canva designs tend to be a bit pixelated. Desygner allows those with a bit technical know how to tweak a few more attributes. It‚Äôs layout is similar as Canva but editing is thankfully more advanced and produces crisp images. It will definitely not disappoint however it does need a meticulous eye for detail. You can find it here: [**Android App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delgeo.desygner) & [**Website**](https://desygner.com/)

#### **10\. [Waveapps](https://www.waveapps.com/invoice-mobile) /[Receiptsbywave](https://www.waveapps.com/receipts/)**

Need an invoice/receipt app for your business? Then this is the best choice. It is absolutely free. The interface is Material UI. Note however these are 2 different apps merged into one. I have used Wave and can strongly recommend it to anyone looking for clean invoices, reports and receipts. It allows customization of your brand name, logo as well as email messages that will be sent out with the receipts. Receipts by Wave allows you to scan receipts so as to have softcopy versions as opposed to files of receipts collecting dust in a shelf. Find it here: **[Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waveapps.sales&_branch_match_id=716718307392736495)** & **[Website](https://waveapps.com)**

#### **11\. Sendy**

I can't promote this app enough. I have used it back in the days of Geeky Technologies to transport computers, laptops and others all over Nairobi and surrounding areas and i still use it till now. One of the best local delivery service. Their best feature is **the Runner option** for close distances especially with CBD, where you can pay as little 100 for a pick and drop. You can find it here: **[Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sendy.co.ke.sendyy&hl=en)** & **[Website](https://www.sendyit.com/)**

#### **12\. Franz**

It gets little annoying having to open multiple social media websites every time just to reply with a short message, close it, open another, do the same and close it. This is where Frans comes in. It is a desktop app that allows you to manage WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram and many many more. It is a messaging app that combines chat & messaging services into one application. Say no to 14 tabs. You can find it here: **[Website](https://meetfranz.com/)**. Sadly no android app.

#### **13\. Page Manager by Facebook**

I cant tell you how many times this app has helped me manage multiple Facebook business accounts. It‚Äôs an overlooked tool but here‚Äôs why you should maximize on it. Page manager has a schedule feature as well as a combined inbox that shows you Facebook messages, Instagram comments and Instagram direct messages. This is essential for someone managing a large account or planning to grow into a large account. You can find it here: **[Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.pages.app&hl=en_GB)** [](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.pages.app&hl=en_GB) [**Only**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.pages.app&hl=en_GB)

#### 14\. **Firefox Send**

This lets you share files with end-to-end encryption and a link that automatically expires. So you can keep what you share private and make sure your stuff doesn‚Äôt stay online forever. Firefox Send makes it simple to share large file sizes - perfect for sharing professional design files or collaborating on a presentation with co-workers. With Send you can share file sizes up to 1GB quickly. Sign up for a free Firefox account to send files up to 2.5GB. You can find it here: **[Android App(BETA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefoxsend&hl=en_GB)** & **[Website](https://send.firefox.com/)**

#### Unsplash

The source of freely useable images. All high resolution. I use this if i am designing a website and more. It has over 1 million free high resolution images. Find it here: **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)** and **[Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.b_lam.resplashh)**

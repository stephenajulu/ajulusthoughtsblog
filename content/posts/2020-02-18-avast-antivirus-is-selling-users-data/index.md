The popular antivirus program Avast has been selling users data to giant companies like Google, Home Depot, Microsoft and Pepsi, according to an [**investigation**](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qjdkq7/avast-antivirus-sells-user-browsing-data-investigation) by Motherboard and PCMag.

It appears that Avast has been scraping data from its antivirus software and handing it off to its subsidiary [**Jumpshot**](https://www.jumpshot.com/about). [**Jumpshot**](https://www.jumpshot.com/about) then repackaged the data and sold it, sometimes for millions of dollars. While Avast required users to opt-in to this data sharing, the investigation found that many were unaware that [**Jumpsho**t](https://www.jumpshot.com/about) was selling their data.

Avast claims to have more than 435 million active users per month, and [**Jumpshot**](https://www.jumpshot.com/about) says it has data from 100 million devices. Avast collects data from users that opt-in and then provides that to [**Jumpshot**](https://www.jumpshot.com/about), but multiple Avast users told Motherboard they were not aware Avast sold browsing data, raising questions about how informed that consent is.

The data sold includes everything from:

- Google searches
- Google Maps location searches
- Activity on companies’ LinkedIn pages
- YouTube video visits and
- Data on people visiting porn websites.

The data is supposedly anonymized and does not include personal information, like names or contact info, but experts fear that it could be possible to de-anonymize certain users.

### I’m using Avast! What should I do?

The report claims that much of the data collected by Avast originates in a browser plugin meant to inform users about cyberattacks and unauthorized connections. If you haven’t used this extension, your data may be safe.

That said, it still might be a better idea to shake Avast for something a bit more secure. It’s also worth pointing out that many antivirus programs, although useful, don’t always work as intended.

One defense we can absolutely recommend is Windows Defender, which is Microsoft’s built-in security suite. Windows Defender packs all the virus protection you need, and is backed by frequent updates and security patches that protect your entire operating system. Nowadays Defender is competent enough to be the main antivirus software for windows users. But we recommend pairing it with [**Malwarebytes**](https://malwarebytes.com) for 99% protection.

Why would they do this? Then head over to another article i wrote on the importance of data: [**Data, The New Gold**](https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com/2020/01/18/data-the-new-gold/)

And always remember this, nothing is ever truly free. Avoid free products, softwares and free things in general. See my data protection article: [**Data Protection & Security Tips**](https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com/2020/01/27/basic-data-security/)

Free is never truly free. Data is the new gold!

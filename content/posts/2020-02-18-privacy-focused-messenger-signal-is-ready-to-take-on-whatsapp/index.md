Signal continues to experience a stunning growth rate as the Play Store reveals that Signal has been downloaded between 10 million and 100 million times already. Combined with founder Moxie Marlinspike’s statement that more than 40% of Signal users are on iOS, you get a respectable (but still comparatively small) number.

Of course, the foundation also continues working on improving privacy. Marlinspike shares that the team has a “secure value recovery” in the pipeline which will allow users to store encrypted contacts on Signal’s servers. That might mitigate the need to identify contacts via phone numbers in the future, a practice that has been widely criticized by privacy advocates as one of the messenger’s weak spots. Another problem many security experts gripe with is Signal’s reliance on Intel’s Software Guard Extensions (SGX). It’s a platform designed for secure remote computation, but it has been successfully attacked multiple times over the last few years.

I went to the secure side a long time ago. However i still use Whatsapp because most of my peers use it. I know only 3 people on Signal. Let's hope that number rises.

20\. **Cache**  
When you have downloaded or read the web page, the data is cached which means that the data is temporarily stored on your computer. Next time, you want that page, it can automatically load the page from through the cache, instead of accessing the web server. In fact, it is also called as the cache memory and it is used to load the pages quickly

21\. **Server hosting**  
Servers are devices that support a company's computer and Internet networks, and "host" all its associated data. They are typically owned by Internet service providers (ISPs), which lease out server space in addition to providing customers with Internet connectivity.

22\. **Data center**  
A data center is a facility that houses computer and data-storage systems, including servers. Many data centers are owned by ISPs or large companies, like Google or Amazon. Linux hosting. Linux is an open-source operating system that can be installed on Web-hosting servers. Many servers run Microsoft operating systems, but some businesses believe that Linux is a more secure and reliable option, and so prefer to choose Web-hosting services that run Linux.

23\. **Back end**  
What you see when you click on a Web page is the front end. The back end is everything else behind the scenes of that page, like Web servers, databases or applications that make the page work. When developing your website, what is in the back end can have an effect on what search engines see.

24\. **Virtual private network (VPN)**  
A VPN allows users to connect to a private network from anywhere for added security. For instance, instead of using the public network at a local coffee shop or hotel room, which comes with a heightened security risk, employees can connect to your private network with the same security as if they were in the office.

25\. **Web app**  
This is a Web page that looks and acts like an app on a smartphone or tablet. Web apps provide viewers with a familiar format and more intuitive navigation, and are immediately mobile friendly.

26\. **Application programming interface (API)**  
An API is what helps different components of software work together so that they all seem to operate as a single software. Such interfaces are very common and help coordinate numerous "moving parts" to make a program or app easy to use.

27\. **Domain name service (DNS).** Every domain name is translated into numbers as an IP address when it is entered into a browser's address bar. The DNS is a directory of those numbers.

28\. **Open source.** Open source describes code that is available publicly and that anyone can use. People can take it and modify it for their purposes.

29\. **Machine learning.** An example of machine learning is Siri, Apple's AI (artificial intelligence) personal assistant. By inferring a general set of rules, refined by use, the algorithm finds an approximate solution in place of having a specific algorithm for each individual function.

30\. **Cloud hosting.** Companies that don't lease servers may instead pay for data to be stored on virtual servers. These servers are said to be based in the cloud if they can be accessed only with an Internet connection. Businesses typically access cloud-based servers through software interfaces specific to their cloud-hosting service providers. Cloud backup. Data backed up in the cloud is transferred from a business to the data-storage provider's servers over the Internet. Cloud backup, also called online backup, can be set up to occur automatically, making it a convenient data-storage option. It's also an affordable service because it does not require the use of any additional hardware on the part of the business.

SaaS usually can be paid for on a monthly basis, making it more affordable than other software options. Many business-management software packages, such as project management software, are now also available in SaaS form.

32\. **Content management systems (CMS).** These are used to manage the content of a website. They usually include a Web-based publishing feature, which allows for editing and formatting of content without the use of a Web coding language, like HTML. Many CMS also feature one-to-one marketing tools that enable targeted advertising.

33\. **Custom software development.** Some businesses require tailor-made software for their daily operations. Instead of using mass-produced software packages, such businesses use programs created by software development companies or in-house software development groups.

34\. **ERP software.** Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software allows a company to manage various aspects of a business — such as accounting, inventory and human relations — in one place. Companies purchase the enterprise software modules that are relevant to their business and use the ERP software to view all the data collected by these modules in a uniform manner.

35\. **Business intelligence (BI) software.** BI is the information a business collects about itself. This can include a very broad swath of data, which is why businesses often need business intelligence software.

37\. **Pixels per Inch (PPI)**  
PPI—also known as “density”—describes the amount of pixels (small dots of light that combine to create an image) per inch on a device display. The higher the PPI count, the sharper images and text will appear.

38\. **Raster Images**  
Raster images are computer graphics made of pixels that can be edited pixel-by-pixel with programs like Painter and Photoshop. Raster image are stored in familiar image file types like GIFs, JPEGs, and PNGs.

39\. **Resolution**  
Resolution is the number of pixels that can be shown on a device’s display. As with PPI, the higher the resolution on a display the more pixels can be shown, making images and texts sharper.

40\. **Retina display**  
is a term trademarked by Apple for an electronic device display with density so high (usually over 300 ppi) that people can’t see the individual pixels. Apple uses these high density displays in Apple Watches, iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and iMacs.

41\. **Vector Images**  
Vector images are made up of lines that are calculated mathematically. Because of the images’ line composition (instead of being composed by individual pixels), they can’t be styled to the same degree as raster images, but they don’t lose lose quality when they’re magnified (pixel-based raster images start to look like a collection of squares when zoomed-in too closely), whereas vector images can be infinitely scaled up. You can use programs like Adobe Photoshop to work with vectors.

42\. **Sitemaps**  
Sitemaps are outlines or maps of the pages that make up a website. They show the relationship between the pages and links, apps, videos, or other components, and can take the form of a document or its own page on the website.

52\. **Frameworks**  
are collection of programs and components commonly used in software development. Rather than spending time seeking out each of these components separately, developers can take advantage of frameworks where they are collected in one place. Examples of frameworks include Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, AngularJS, and Joomla.

53\. **Object-oriented programming (OOP)**  
Object-oriented programming is a type of computer programming/software design that focuses on the creation of objects that have specific and unique attributes and abilities. In OOP, computer programs are made up of these created objects that then interact with one another. This is in contrast to earlier programming languages that focus more on the process of turning input data into output data rather than the data (objects) itself. Examples of OOP languages include Ruby, PHP, and Python.

54\. **Cloud computing**  
Cloud computing is a practice where data is not stored locally on your own computer, but instead is spread out among a number of remote servers accessible through the internet. Service like Google Docs, Facebook, and Gmail are examples of cloud computing—you are interacting with data on your home computer that is stored externally in “the cloud.”

55\. **Firewalls**  
Firewalls are systems designed to protect and secure a computer network—everything from a commercial web service to your home WiFi network—from external security risks. Firewalls monitor inbound and outbound network traffic and determine whether or not to allow the traffic through based on a user-defined set of security standards.

56\. **Routers**  
Routers are the devices used to connect personal computers to the internet via a service provider like cable or DSL. The device that your computer is either directly connected to via an Ethernet cable or that you use to access your home WiFi network is a router.

Virtual machine is software that makes it possible to use one computer operating system (like Windows 10) on a computer running another system (like a MacBook Pro). Examples include Virtual Box, Parallels, and VMWare.

59\. **Big data**  
Big data is a term for collections of data that are so large they can’t be processed through traditional data processing systems. These collections come from sources like mobile devices, emails, search keywords, user database information, applications, and servers. By finding ways to comb through this data, companies can identify consumer patterns and use them to predict and optimize their business.

60\. **Data architecture**  
How data is collected, stored, accessed, and used in companies and organizations

61\. **Database**  
Data architecture describes the way data is collected, stored, accessed, and used in companies and organizations. It can be seen as the roadmap for how data flows across an organization’s IT systems and applications.

62\. **Data modeling**  
Determining what kind of data is needed and how it will be structured and organized

63\. **Data visualization**  
Data visualization is the use of graphs, charts, tables, infographics, etc. in order to define and communicate data being analyzed and the the findings that have come from it.

64\. **Relational database management system (RDMS)**  
RDMSs are used to organize data into tables—the data can then be accessed or reassembled without having to reorganize the database tables. Examples of RDMS include SAP and MySQL.

65\. **Hybrid app**s  
are applications that will work on different platforms (computers, mobile devices, tablets) and are a combination of a native app (one that is stored locally on your device) and a web app (one that is accessed through a web browser on the Internet). Amazon and Apple App Stores, Twitter, Yelp, and Gmail are all examples of hybrid apps.

66\. **IDE (Integrated development environment)**  
IDE is a software application that includes tools like source code editors (text editors specifically designed for writing code), debuggers (tools for testing code), and build automation tools (tools for compiling code into machine-readable format and running automated tests). Examples of IDE’s include Eclipse, Visual Studio, and VIM.

67\. **Native apps**

Native apps are made specifically for certain platforms. They only run on the platforms they were built for, and are stored locally on those devices. Mail for iOS and Ingress for Android are both examples of native apps.

68\. **NFC (Near Field Communication)**  
NFC is technology that lets mobile devices communicate using radio waves when they’re very close to each other (about four inches or less) and is used for services like sharing files, pairing accessories, or wireless payments. Companies can use NFC to make products interactive with consumers’ mobile devices, such as including NFC-enabled tags on products that allow users to register products, get discounts, or place new orders with their mobile device.

69\. **Responsive Web Design**  
Responsive web design is the practice of designing websites so that they adapt gracefully to different-sized devices like phones, tablets, wearable devices, etc. If you’re able to visit a website on your phone and it looks just as proportional and seamless as it does on your computer, it’s an example of responsive web design.

70\. **SDK (Software Development Kit)**  
SDK is a set of tools for creating specific types of software. SDK’s are released by companies that control the platform the software is being developed for. For instance, apps developed for iOS require the iOS SDK, Windows apps require the .NET Framework SDK, and Java apps require the Java Development Kit.

71\. **DoS/DDoS Attack**  
"Denial-of-service" or "distributed denial-of-service" attack. An attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. DoS threats usually target websites or services hosted on high-profile web servers like banks and credit card payment gateways, but they're also common in business in the form of website attacks.  
For example, one common type of attack on businesses would be attempting a service overload -- i.e. flooding a network with so much information that it either can't respond to legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly that it's basically useless.

72\. **Interface/GUI**  
GUI stands for "graphical user interface," known also as simply "interface." An interface is the part of a piece of software that the end user actually sees and interacts with.

73\. **IP Address**  
"Internet Protocol address." A numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

74\. **ISP**  
"Internet service provider." An organization (commercial, community-owned, nonprofit, or otherwise privately owned) that provides internet services.

To begin, i need to mention that Windows Defender is doing a pretty good job at protecting your Windows 10 computer.

So all you need is a second option malware scanner. One that doesn't take the role of your main antivirus but comes with all/some of the features to become one. One of such is [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/), the current best second option antivirus. It has both a business and home version.

The home version comes with a 15 day trial, in which all the services are free and mostly automated. It scans your computer daily. Alerts you when browsing a malicious website etc as i mentioned above it can do everything a regular antivirus can sometimes even better. This together with Windows Defender and you have a pretty well secured computer/laptop. However once the trial is done, you'll either need to buy the full version or settle with the free version which has most of it's features turned off. Meaning you'll need to be running scans by yourself, regularly. If you dont want that then here is a list of the best free antivirus software around according to [AV-TEST](https://www.av-test.org/en/), a company that tests antivirus software with real live tests. Then rate them according to their performance, battery drain and overall score at beating malwares and viruses. Since these tests are run regularly you can be rest assured that whichever you choose might protect you from zero day exploits and most of the modern malware developed. To quote from their about page:

> _**The AV-TEST GmbH is the independent research institute for IT security from Germany. For more than 15 years, the experts from Magdeburg have guaranteed quality-assuring comparison and individual tests of virtually all internationally relevant IT security products.  
> One of the largest collections of digital malware samples in the world, the Institute's own research department, as well as intensive collaboration with other institutions, guarantee tests on an internationally recognized level and at the current state of the art. AV-TEST utilizes analysis systems developed in-house for its tests, thus guaranteeing test results uninfluenced by third parties and comprehensible at all times for all standard operating systems and platforms.**_

Now to the antivirus softwares that have maintained their level.

**NB: A remainder** all of these are free, they might come with a trial run of their more equipped and powerful pro versions but once the trial is over, you are guaranteed at least 94% protection against malware, trojans, ransomware and worms.

My current choice products for free antivirus utility are Avast Free Antivirus and Kaspersky Free. Avast gets very good scores from the independent labs, and Kaspersky took near-perfect scores in recent tests. On the other hand, Avast includes some useful bonus features not found in Kaspersky, including a password manager and a network security scanner. If you do have a little cash in your budget for security, the best paid antivirus software does offer more and better protection. If not, try a few of these free tools and see which one you like best.

### AVAST FREE ANTIVIRUS

**Pros:** Very good scores from independent testing labs and our hands-on tests. Network security inspector. Password manager. Many useful, security-related bonus features. Free.  
**Cons:** Password manager features limited. Some bonus features require separate purchase.  
**Bottom Line:** Avast Free Antivirus combines an antivirus engine that scores very well in testing with a surprisingly extensive collection of bonus features.

### KARSPERSKY FREE

**Pros:** Perfect scores from four independent testing labs. Perfect score in our phishing protection test. Good scores in our malware-blocking and malicious URL blocking tests. Free  
**Cons:** No direct tech support. RAM and Battery consumption issue but they seem to be working on it  
**Bottom Line:** Kaspersky Free offers full-scale malware protection that gets perfect scores from the independent labs, and it won't cost you a penny.

### AVG Antivirus Free

**Pros:** Very good scores in multiple independent lab tests and our own hands-on tests.  
**Cons:** Initial scan slower than average. No longer offers web protection browser extension.  
**Bottom Line:** AVG AntiVirus Free offers precisely the same antivirus protection engine as Avast Free Antivirus, but lacks the impressive collection of bonus features that you get with Avast.

### BITDEFENDER ANTIVIRUS FREE EDITION

**Pros:** Same antivirus protection as for-pay Bitdefender. Excellent scores from independent testing labs. Top antiphishing score.  
**Cons:** Lacks all features of the for-pay Bitdefender beyond core antivirus protection.  
**Bottom Line:** Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition includes precisely the same antivirus technology found in the commercial Bitdefender Antivirus, without the paid edition's many useful bonus features.

### Check Point ZoneAlarm Free Antivirus+

**Pros:** Antivirus protection licensed from Kaspersky. Tough, effective two-way firewall. Free. Bonus features.  
**Cons:** No antivirus lab test results. Lacks some antivirus features. No protection for malicious or fraudulent websites. Behavioral detection tars good and bad programs in testing. Personal data protection fails in testing.  
**Bottom Line:** Check Point ZoneAlarm Free Antivirus+ combines Kaspersky-powered antivirus with an effective firewall, but it lacks protection against malicious and fraudulent websites, and some of its bonus features don't work.

### BONUS: AhnLab V3 Internet Security

V3 Internet Security is an Advanced Security Software. It works Best for detecting the Virus through continuous System Monitoring. This Software Interface has System Security, Email Protection, and System Tuning Tool with Few more Small Tools embedded in each of these Features. Anti-Spyware, Web Security, Mail Security, Firewall, USB External Drive are the Important Features of the AhnLab V3 Internet Security. Of all the Tools, V3 Internet Security works best to reduce the usage of System Resources. It performs a Fast and Perfect Virus Scan to detect the entire virus infected file in the System.  
At the time of writing this post AhnLab is number 1 in the [AV-TEST](https://www.av-test.org/en/). In my opinion, it's interface(At least the one i used an year ago) is/was quite challenging. Maybe they changed i would encourage you to go check it out.

This laptop is so slim that the manufacturers term it as, slim as an empty wallet. Something am sure most of us would all want. Portability is the right word. Measuring only 16.2 mm thick and weighing 1.53 kg for both laptops, this laptop is meant for everyday carry.

The laptop generally feels good and very lightweight. One could comfortable hold it with one hand (Though not advised as it can easily slip). It has a great look with ZED perfectly engraved on the back. It is perfect for Students, Young entrepreneurs, Mobile workers, Online money makers and those who prefer lightweight devices. It doesn't have fans, so you wont expect those irritating fun noises during heavy use.

It features a full sized keyboard and touchpad that enables easy navigation with a comfortable typing experience. It features a USB 2.0 port(2 ports for Zed Air), though not as fast as USB 3.0 but good enough. Also comes with 2 GB R.A.M and a 32 GB SSD (Though technically this is quite small, it is an SSD! Meaning High Speeds, no noise and faster boot time) To crumb this small space, it has a Micro SD slot extendable up-to 64 GB Memory Card. Apart from that it comes with the latest and fastest Wi-Fi connection, which is IEE 802.11a/b/g/n. Bonus features: It comes with 100 GB of One Drive Cloud Storage and 1 month of free Microsoft Office plus 5 GB online storage.

One thing i loved about it, is its battery capacity. A whooping of 5,400 / 10,000 mAH that will take you for up to 8 hours on a single charge, incredible right, it survives more hours than typical laptops which only last 2 to 3 hours.

The stereo speakers are loud enough to fill a room. All this and the device are powered by an Intel Atom 1.85 Quad Core with Intel HD graphics, which has a satisfactory performance and high energy efficiency. Bluetooth v4.0, audio jack is also included.
